# gen-ai-sql
This repo contains the code base to create and manage
docker containers mainly jupyter notebook and mysql db. A single 
docker compose command can be used to spin up containers which
can be used to interact with google PALM api.

This repo was mainly created to demonstrate the usage of LLMs with databases. We need to feed our database to the LLM on which we need 
to query data. Once the database is exposed to the LLM, we can query data from the database using 
natural language.

The python code to do so is provided in the jupyter notebook.

P.S : LLMs can give wrong output pertaining to erroneous SQL generated by the LLM.
Future scope of improvement would be to feed the output of the LLM to a vector dataset
and follow up with a Few Short Learning technique to teach the LLM to provide proper answers.

## command to spin up the jupyter notebook and mysql container

<code>docker-compose -f mysql-docker-compose.yaml up -d </code>

## command to connect to mysql db

<code>docker exec -it mysql-5.7 mysql -u root -p  </code> </br>
Enter the password to the root user. Can be found in the docker compose file.
